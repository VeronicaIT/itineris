## Data Management Plan (DMP)

If you are a member of the Itineris ANR project, you will have to send us information about the data you are managing, or yo will manage (DMP) during the project time. Start to read the HTML output of the [**fact sheet**](https://zoometh.github.io/itineris/dmp/), and look at what you can improve and complete. Missing information are quoted 'XXX' (search for this pattern). Look also the '.tsv' the descriptive data that feeds this **fact sheet**:

  + [data_resume](https://github.com/zoometh/itineris/blob/main/data/data_resume.tsv): total number of objects by WP, number of sites, etc.
  
  + [tools_resume](https://github.com/zoometh/itineris/blob/main/data/tools_resume.tsv): tools, and outputs resulting from the use of these tools, ordered by WP and tasks.
  
  + [isos_resume](https://github.com/zoometh/itineris/blob/main/data/isos_resume.tsv): isostandards planned to be used ordered by WP.
  
  + [mbr_nodes_resume](https://github.com/zoometh/itineris/blob/main/data/mbr_nodes_resume.tsv): information about WP, task and members.

To complete or modify the content of these files, you can:

  + identify things to complete and send us a mail with a brief description 
  
```
To: Thomas Huet <thomashuet7@gmail.com>
Cc: Veronica Cicolani <veronica.cicolani@ens.fr>
```

  + copy a '.tsv' file (*tabular separated values*), complete it, and send it back to us (eg. [copy/paste 'isos_resume.tsv'](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoometh/itineris/main/data/isos_resume.tsv))
  
Maybe you can start verifying your institutional attachment, WP, task, and credits (names and ORCID), [here](https://zoometh.github.io/itineris/dmp/#Membres_du_projet_et_Work_packages) and [there]((https://github.com/zoometh/itineris/blob/main/data/mbr_nodes_resume.tsv)...
  
* If you are comfortable with R, GitHub, etc.

  + select the [fact sheet itself](https://github.com/zoometh/itineris/blob/main/dmp/index.Rmd), a '.Rmd' file (R + [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)), complete it, and send it back to us (eg. [copy/paste 'isos_resume.tsv'](https://github.com/zoometh/itineris/blob/main/data/isos_resume.tsv))
  
  + do this directly on GitHub with commits, push and pull requests, connecting you with your GitHub account
